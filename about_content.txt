Ariel Armoni (b. 1983) is a Tel Aviv-based architect and a 2015 graduate of the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. He is the founder of an exhibition design studio that specializes in creating spatial experiences for museums and cultural institutions.

The studio has experience with a wide range of projects, from contemporary art and archaeology to ethnography and interactive environments. Our work covers the entire process—from early curatorial development to the final construction phase. We use advanced digital tools and 3D visualizations to define the atmosphere and flow of every exhibition before it is built, providing close supervision throughout the journey.
