I am an architect and the founder of an exhibition design studio specializing in evocative spatial experiences for museums and cultural institutions. A graduate of the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, I lead a practice that bridges meticulous architectural planning with a deep understanding of content and audience engagement.

My studio provides a comprehensive design umbrella: from the development of the curatorial concept to the technical realization of complex installations. With a rich background across contemporary art, archaeology, ethnography and interactive environments, I tailor a unique formal and material language to every project, ensuring that the final execution is a seamless reflection of its underlying message.
